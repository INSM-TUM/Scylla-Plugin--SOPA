Simulate models with sustainability info, process and visualize the simulation results.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
The plugin works by extending Scylla, a business process simulator, by processing sustainability information
of a business process, passing it through the Scylla simulation and outputs data insights.
### Why sustainability information important?
Provides insights to the environmental impact of business processes/activities.
### What is Cost Driver?
Cost Driver is the term used to describe the cost of an activity.
### What is Cost Variant?
Cost Variant is a process instance with a different combination of activities, thus different cost drivers.
### What is LCA Scores?
A quantified score of environmental impacts associated with the life cycle of a commercial product.
## üéØObjective
### üõ†Ô∏è How to run it?
***Please remember to change the path in pom.xml to your own Absolute Path of your scylla.jar file***
1. Navigate to src/main/java/cost_driver/Main and run.
2. Select the desired configuration files and "cost_driver" as plugin.

4. The logged data files will be found in a folder with format: "output_yy_mm_dd...."


## üß± Components
There are three Plugins cooperating to achieve this.

### Global Configuration Parser Plugin
Parses the global config file of format as such:
```ruby
<bsim:costDriver>
    <bsim:abstractCostDriver id="Delivery" defaultTimeUnit="HOURS">
      <bsim:concreteCostDeiver id="Delivery_B_Small_Lorry" cost="0.00005524"/>
      <bsim:concreteCostDeiver id="Delivery_B_Lorry" cost="0.00004265"/>
    </bsim:abstractCostDriver>
```
### Simulation Configuration Parser Plugin
Parses the simulation config file of format as such:
```ruby
bsim:costVariantConfig>
      <bsim:variant id="Shipment and delivery over distance A" frequency="0.2">
        <bsim:driver id="Delivery" cost="0.00002843"/>
      </bsim:variant>
```
### Logger Plugin
Logs the extended simulation data in the form of an XES and XML file.
