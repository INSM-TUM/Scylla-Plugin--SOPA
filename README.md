# BearCrow
Simulate models with sustainability info, process and visualize the simulation results.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
The plugin works by extending Scylla, a business process simulator, by processing sustainability information
of a business process, passing it through the Scylla simulation and outputs data insights.
### Why sustainability information important?
Provides insights to the environmental impact of business processes/activities.
### What is Cost Driver?
Cost Driver is the term used to describe the cost of an activity.
### What is Cost Variant?
Cost variants govern what specific combinations of concretizations can occur during individual process instances based on the environmental cost driver hierarchy ‚Äî in other words, what sets of concrete environmental cost drivers can, during process execution, take the place of the abstract environmental cost drivers during activity execution.
### What is LCA Scores?
A quantified score of environmental impacts associated with the life cycle of a commercial product.
## üéØObjective
### üõ†Ô∏è How to run it?
***Please remember to change the path in pom.xml to your own Absolute Path of your scylla.jar file***
1. Navigate to src/main/java/cost_driver/Main and run.
2. Select the desired configuration files and "cost_driver" as plugin.

3. The logged data files will be found in a folder with format: "output_yy_mm_dd...."


## üß± Components
There are three Plugins cooperating to achieve this.

### Global Configuration Parser Plugin
Parses the global config file of which describes the abstractCDs and the concreteCDs that it consists of:
The
```ruby
<bsim:costDriver>
    <bsim:abstractCostDriver id="Delivery" defaultTimeUnit="HOURS">
      <bsim:concreteCostDeiver id="Delivery_B_Small_Lorry" cost="0.00005524"/>
      <bsim:concreteCostDeiver id="Delivery_B_Lorry" cost="0.00004265"/>
    </bsim:abstractCostDriver>
```
### Simulation Configuration Parser Plugin
Parses the simulation config file which describes the cost variant by id, frequency of occurence, and cost:
```ruby
bsim:costVariantConfig>
      <bsim:variant id="Shipment and delivery over distance A" frequency="0.2">
        <bsim:driver id="Delivery" cost="0.00002843"/>
      </bsim:variant>
```
### Logger Plugin
Logs the extended simulation data in the form of an XES and XML file.  

## Results
The outputted file shows a complete detailed breakdown of sustainability info.
